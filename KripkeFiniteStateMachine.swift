/**
 *  A Finite State Machine that is able to have a Kripke Structure generated
 *  from it.
 *
 *  Finite State Machines (FSMs) are defined as an algorithm that can be in any
 *  number of a finite set of states.  Each state therefore represents a single
 *  situation that a Finite State Machine can be in, and executes certain logic.
 *
 *  An FSM must contain a state that is labelled the initial state, which
 *  represents where the FSM starts its execution.  The `initialState` property
 *  represents this state.
 *
 *  The actual execution logic is seperated into seperate types that conform to
 *  the `Ringlet` protocol.  The FSM therefore delegates the execution of its 
 *  states to `ringlet`.
 *
 *  The FSM keeps track of what to execute with the `currentState` and
 *  `previousState` properties.  The `currentState` represents the next state to
 *  execute and the `previousState` represents the last state that was executed.
 *  
 *  An FSM is capable of being suspended, in which case the FSM uses the 
 *  `suspendState` and `suspendedState`.  Instead of doing something similar to
 *  making `currentState` an optional state when we suspend, the FSM first sets
 *  the `suspendedState` to `currentState` and then sets `currentState` to
 *  `suspendState`.  `suspendState` therefore represents the state that is
 *  executed when the FSM is suspended.  The `suspendedState` represents the
 *  next state to execute once the FSM is resumed after being suspended.
 *
 *  An FSM is also a `VariablesContainer`.  Every state that is executed has
 *  access to FSM local variables, or rather variables that are shared amongst
 *  all the states of an FSM.  The FSM therefore stores these variables in
 *  `vars`.
