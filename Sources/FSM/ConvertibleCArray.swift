/**
 *  Provides a wrapper for C arrays that contain a certain type but need to be
 *  converted to a second type.
 *
 *  For instance a use case for this struct is with the gusimplewhiteboard.  The
 *  individual messages in the whiteboard are stored as gu_simple_messages, but
 *  the developer would like to cast these to the message that they are using.
 *  By using a ConvertibleCArray we can convert from the gu_simple_message to a
 *  wb_point for instance.
 *
 *  This struct uses an underlying `CArray` which actually stores the values.
 *  Therefore this struct works much like a proxy where it delegates most of its
 *  implementation to the underlying `CArray`.  Where this struct actually
 *  provides a difference in the implementation from `CArray` is when 
 *  retrieving/modifying the elements in the array.  When retrieving an element
 *  from the array, this struct does delegate to the underlying array, however
 *  the struct then converts the retrieved value to `To`.  When modifying
 *  elements this struct does the reverse where it first converts the new
 *  element to `From` before delegating to the underlying `CArray`.
